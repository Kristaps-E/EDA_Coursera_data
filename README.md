# **Coursera Course Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## **Description:**
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Coursera course data, with the goal of cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data to uncover meaningful insights. The dataset is sourced from the Coursera website, containing various attributes related to courses such as course titles, categories, ratings, and more. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, with visualizations that highlight key trends and patterns.

## **Position statement for this sprint project:**
In this sprint project, I assume the role of a Data Scientist for an innovative organization dedicated to shaping the future of education. Our mission is to empower universities, colleges, and bootcamps by helping them design impactful courses that resonate with learners worldwide. Leveraging insights from the Coursera course dataset, I provide strategic, data-driven recommendations to craft courses that not only achieve high enrollment but also transform lives through education—while ensuring tangible business success for our partners.

## **EDA Objectives:**
- Observe the data provided by Coursera:
Examine and understand the structure, completeness, and overall trends in the dataset.

- Understand student enrollment based on course difficulty:
Analyze how course difficulty levels affect student enrollment and identify which difficulty levels attract more learners.

- Gain insights into the course types that are most likely to have higher enrollment:
Evaluate which course types (e.g., Course, Specialization, Professional Certificate) show a correlation with higher enrollment rates.

- Identify potential ways to achieve good enrollment levels and reach the top courses by enrollment:
Investigate strategies or course characteristics that contribute to higher enrollment and appearing in the top courses.

- Identify the top topics that courses with the highest enrollment focus on:
Analyze the most popular course topics and identify key subject areas for high-enrollment courses.

- Provide a suggestion for an ideal number of courses to start with:
Based on the data, recommend an optimal number of courses to launch to achieve successful enrollment rates.

- Provide further suggestions for making more relevant decisions:
Offer additional recommendations that can enhance decision-making, such as considering regional trends, course duration, or industry relevance.

## **Tools:**
Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: The environment where the EDA is conducted.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

## **Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is coursea_data.csv, which contains data about Coursera courses and has specific data like:
- Course title
- Course category
- Rating
- Difficulty level
- Number of enrolled learners

## **Installation/Setup Instructions:**
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required libraries in the terminal: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Write "jupyter notebook" in the terminal and let it open the repository.
5. Open the Coursera_EDA.ipynb file and run the cells to explore the dataset.

## **Usage:**
The notebook is divided into sections that guide the user through the EDA process:
- Data loading & inspection: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure.
- Data cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Exploratory analysis and Data visualization: analyze various aspects of the dataset, including course ratings, difficulty, and categories, as well as visualize the findings using various types of plots, including histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots
- EDA Summary with conclusion & suggestions: Summarizes the key insights discovered during the analysis and gives suggestions for further improvement


## **EDA Summary**
To attract enrollment for new courses, I offer the following observations and recommendations to help the organization develop relevant and valuable courses that will drive high enrollment rates.
Data gives deeper insights for understanding the  value of:
- Difficulty
- Course Type
- Course Topic
- Collaboration with an Organization
- Course Count

##  **Suggestions for further improvement:**
With more time and data, I could dive deeper into the data to provide even more valuable insights to help guide decisions for course development.

For example:

- Analyze courses with fewer than 15 courses
- Look into other course topics in this data set
- Include price data
- Incorporate course length data
- Gather data on course topic relevance from employers
- Analyse regional enrollment data in Coursera courses
- Examine upcoming trends for 2025
- Make more interactive visualizations
- Look into other learning platforms
- Use clustering to find patterns
